/**
 * Publish.jsx — /p/:owner/:repo/publish (max-width 760px)
 *
 * Put a project on the web so anyone can open it in a browser. GitHub calls
 * this Pages.
 *
 * Help used to say outright that Plainly cannot publish for you. That sentence
 * is now false, and has been rewritten — a promise in Help that the app can't
 * keep is the same category of problem as inventing a number.
 *
 * The one thing this screen must never do is claim a site is live before
 * GitHub says it is. Building takes a minute or two, and "building" is shown
 * as its own state rather than as success.
