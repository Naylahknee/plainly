 * The project-level status pill, so Home and My Projects can never disagree.

 * Every answer is something Plainly actually knows: unsaved edits are drafts
 * sitting on this computer, and the review states come from stored update
 * records. "Up to date" means nothing is outstanding in Plainly — not a claim
 * about anything it hasn't seen.
