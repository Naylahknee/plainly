/**
 * projectPicker.js — which projects appear in Plainly.
 *
 * Plainly now asks GitHub for everything the account can reach: your own
 * projects, ones shared with you, and every repository in every organisation
 * you belong to. For some accounts that is four projects. For others it is
 * several hundred, most of which you will never touch.
 *
 * So you can choose. Two rules, both about not lying:
 *
 *   1. Choosing nothing shows everything. A first-time user must never open
 *      Plainly to an empty list because of a setting they didn't set.
 *   2. When a choice is active, the screen says how many are hidden. A
 *      filtered list presented as the whole list is a false statement.
 *
 * Hiding affects the lists only. A direct link to a hidden project still
 * opens — this is about what you scroll past, not about access.
