/**
 * commitText.js — turning a commit message into something a person can read.
 *
 * A commit message is written for git: a subject line, then as many paragraphs
 * as the author felt like, then machine-readable trailers. Printing all of it
 * as the summary is how What Changed became a wall of text.
 *
 * Every screen that shows a Save Point uses this, so the same commit reads the
 * same way everywhere:
 *
 *   title    the first line, in Plainly's words
 *   summary  ONE line — the first paragraph, cut at a word boundary
 *   body     everything else, for behind "See details". Nothing is discarded,
 *            it just stops being the first thing you see.
