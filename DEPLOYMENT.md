## Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Flight Checks (Local)
```bash
# ✅ Already done
npm run build  # Verify build passes
npm run dev    # Start dev server
```

### 2. Environment Setup (Production)
```
VITE_API_BASE=https://api.github.com  # Already set
VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<from GH OAuth app>
VITE_GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI=https://plainly.app/auth/callback
```

### 3. Deploy to Vercel
```bash
vercel deploy --prod
# or via GitHub auto-deploy if branch is connected
```

### 4. Post-Deployment Smoke Tests
```
□ Sign in with GitHub
□ See dashboard (/)
□ Navigate to Projects (/projects)
□ Navigate to Help (/help)
□ Click into a project (/p/:repo)
□ View Updates list (/p/:repo/updates)
□ Create a new update (/p/:repo/new-update)
□ View update detail (/p/:repo/u/:updateId)
□ Start Continue with AI flow (/p/:repo/u/:updateId/ai)
□ Check for changes (/p/:repo/u/:updateId/return)
□ Review changes (/p/:repo/u/:updateId/review)
```

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Not Yet Implemented (Marked with "Requires implementation" badge)
1. **ReturnFromAI Branch 3 & 4:** 
   - Branch 3: External commits detection (requires parsing commit authors)
   - Branch 4: Local vs remote conflict detection (requires local state tracking)

2. **ReviewAIChanges Project Check:**
   - Build validation (would need CI integration)
   - Security scan results (would need security tool integration)
   - Broken link detection (would need link crawler)

3. **Story/History:**
   - Full update.story array population (currently shows "Requires implementation" badge)
   - Commit history sync (would need periodic GitHub API polling)

4. **File Management:**
   - File diff visualization (basic diff exists, advanced features pending)
   - Folder hierarchy support (currently filters out folders)
   - Binary file handling (currently text-only)

### Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Dark mode toggle
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Cmd+S to save)
- [ ] Search across updates
- [ ] Bulk operations (multi-select updates)
- [ ] Export to PDF
- [ ] Email notifications
- [ ] Slack integration
- [ ] CLI for headless workflows

## Rollback Plan

If deployment fails:
1. `vercel rollback` (or revert to previous deployment via Vercel dashboard)
2. No database migrations were made, so state is reversible
3. localStorage data is client-side, so users keep their local updates

If critical bug discovered:
1. Revert the commit on main
2. Deploy previous commit: `vercel deploy --prod`
3. Create a hotfix branch for the bug
