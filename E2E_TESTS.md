---

## Network Tests

### Simulated Slow Network
1. DevTools > Network > Slow 3G

3. Should show loading states
4. Should eventually load without hanging

### Offline
1. DevTools > Network > Offline
2. Try to load page
3. Should show appropriate error message
4. Should allow cached content if available

---

## Error Handling Tests

---

## Cross-Window Tests

- [ ] Open app in 2 tabs
- [ ] Create update in tab 1
